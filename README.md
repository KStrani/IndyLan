# About IndyLan
Indylan is an educational tool designed specifically for users to learn not only some of Europeâ€™s endangered languages but also more about the cultures of the people who speak these languages. The tool constitutes a gamified language-learning solution in the form of a mobile application. The IndyLan application will help speakers of English, Spanish, Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish to learn Gaelic, Scots, Cornish, Basque, Galician and Saami.

The modes that will be available in the application are: Vocabulary; Phrases; Dialogues; Grammar; Culture and History as well as Aural Comprehension.

The vocabulary can be practiced in several study modes. Most of the items will be illustrated for easy concept recognition. There will be audio for all vocabulary, phrases, dialogues etc. The app will also include a dedicated Culture tab with texts, music and images, where users will be able to learn more about the heritage and culture of the people speaking the selected endangered languages. At IndyLan, we do not see languages as separate from their speakers.
